        <p>Hi, my name is Mickheil Aaron D. Tayag, and I am a student from the University of the Assumption. I've loved playing video games since I was a child, particularly MMORPGs and Souls games like Elden Ring. I also enjoy listening to video game OSTs and J-pop, with an artist like Hoshimachi Suisei being one of my favorites. My favorite food is lasagna. I see myself in 5 years becoming an IT Support Specialist because it's a profession I'm truly passionate about. Having grown up loving computers, I really want to help people diagnose and fix problems with their desktops.</p>
